	<h1> Founded in 2016 </h1>
	<p> JahFeelZ is a company that is all
about living your lifestyle, no matter what
obstacles may come your way. We are focused on inspiring, uniting, and empowering the youth around the world through positivity.
A percentage of our profits will be donated to families with children receiving treatment at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia Cancer Center. Our goal is to provide these children and their families with necessities and financial help during these hard times. We aim to put a smile on every face and keep a positive attitude throughout treatment.
JahFeelZ wants everyone to be able to live their lifestyle to the fullest, no matter what the
situation may be. </p>
